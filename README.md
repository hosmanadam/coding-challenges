## Hello there,
This is the repo where I collect all of my work on various coding challenges.\
In addition to code, tougher problems may include notes about my thinking process, and incremental improvements of my solution.\
I'm having a lot of fun doing these, and hope you'll find something interesting too.\
See my profiles: 
[@Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/users/adamhosman), 
[@HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/adamhosman), 
[@Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/progress=adamhosman).

### Structure
- Each challenge lives in a a self-contained project folder
- Of any challenge, only one version is live for each language, and that is my best version (may not be the most recent one)
- Other solutions may be left in for reference, but are commented out
- All solutions are mine, unless explicitly noted
- Order:
    1. My solutions, most recent first (may not be the best one)
    2. Other solutions to learn from
    3. Tests (may be in separate module)

### Project names
> NOTE: My script [accept-challenge](https://github.com/hosmanadam/accept-challenge) is used to automate most of this (limited to Python at this time)
- Project folders are named after challenge title: kebab-case version, with non-alpha characters removed
- Files are put in identically named folders
    - Codewars: folder name is prefixed with *kyu grading of kata*, followed by underscore
    - HackerRank: folder name is prefixed with *max score*, followed by underscore
    - Project Euler: folder name is prefixed with *problem number*, followed by underscore
