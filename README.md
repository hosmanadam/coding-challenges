## Hi stranger!
This is the repo where I collect all of my work on various coding challenges. I'm not sure why you're here, but I hope you'll find something interesting.\
The following parts of this readme will detail some standards/conventions I use to keep things organized around here.

***

### Profiles
- Codewars: https://www.codewars.com/users/adamhosman
- Project Euler: https://projecteuler.net/progress=adamhosman

### Versions
- Of any challenge, only one version is live, and that is my best version (may not be the most recent one)
- Other solutions may be left in for reference, but are commented out
- All solutions are mine, unless explicitly noted
- Order:
    1. My solutions, most recent first (may not be the best one)
    2. Other solutions to learn from

### Project names
- Filename is kebab-case version of challenge title, with non-alpha characters removed
- Files are put in identically named folders
    - Project Euler: folder name is prefixed with *problem number*, followed by underscore
    - Codewars: folder name is prefixed with *kyu grading of kata*, followed by underscore

### Formatting
#### Spaces
- Separating blocks by empty lines is done with as few lines as possible
- If a hierarchy arises between empty lines (one separates more than the other) only then is more than one newline added
