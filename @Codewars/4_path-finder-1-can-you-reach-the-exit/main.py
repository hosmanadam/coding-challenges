"""v1 - First try, working pretty good: explores 500x500 maze in ~ 5 seconds

- coordinates are represented as (x, y), use in reverse order for indexing
- paths are tuples of tuples, signifying that we're not modifying any existing paths
- lambdas take 1 pair of coordinates and return their neighbor
- process:
  - we start outside the "entrance" at (0, -1), from where the only possible NSEW step is (0, 0)
    (this is so that on a 1x1 maze, (0, 0) can be "found" as an exit)
  - for each path, we explore possible extensions, and
    - return True if extension is end of maze
    - skip if it's outside board, has negative index, or already visited
    - if empty, add to visited and save as new path
    - if wall, add to visited (this is done passively, not even mentioned in the code)
  - all previous paths are discarded, replaced with list of new
  â†³ repeat until exit is found or all options are depleted

- much faster than mine
- seems to use variable names that come from algorithmic terminology
